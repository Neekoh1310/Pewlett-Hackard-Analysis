# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify the employees who are eligibile to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Resources
- Data Source: Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Data (departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, titles.csv, employees.csv)
- Software: PostGreSQL, pgAdmin 4

## Results and Summary

- Based on the analysis of the expected "Silver Tsunami" of retiring members, here are the numbers of employees by titles:
  1. Senior Engineer: 25,916
  2. Senior Staff: 24,926
  3. Engineer: 9,285
  4. Staff: 7,636
  5. Technique Leader: 3,603
  6. Assistant Enginner: 1,090
  7. Manager: 2

- Based on the analysis of the current employees that are eligibile to participate in a mentorship program, the total number of identified employees is 1,549.

## Summary

- There are not enough employees that are eligible for mentorship programs compared to the number of retiring members.
- Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight:
  1. A query/table for mentorship eligible employees grouped by employment titles.
  2. A number comparison of retirement eligible employees and mentorship eligible employees.
